# No Fun Allowed#

No Fun Allowed is a basic Spotify app to automatically skip songs by the band "Fun." if they are encountered in a playlist.

### How do I set it up? ###

Well there is currently a [moratorium on the acceptance of new spotify apps](https://developer.spotify.com/news-stories/2014/03/24/closure-of-spotify-apps-submissions/) so this is a bit involved right now:

* Make sure you have a [premium account](https://www.spotify.com/us/freetrial/)
* [Register for a developer account](https://devaccount.spotify.com/my-account/).
* Create the Spotify folder if it doesn't exist already: ~/Spotify (Mac OS X and Linux) or My Documents\Spotify (Windows).
* "git clone" this repo into your Spotify directory (or download the zip, whatever)
* In the Spotify search bar type spotify:app:no-fun-allowed
* If the last step doesn't work restart Spotify and try it again.


### Doesn't that seem like a lot of work to not listen to one band? ###

Totally worth it.
